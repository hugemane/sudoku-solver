# sudoku-solver
Project to solve a sudoku puzzle and to test the boundaries of how a program can solve it.

Basic idea is to set values on a Sudoku puzzle and let the program execute and solve in real time.
Instead of machine learning or any form Artificial Intelligence, this will simply use a set of algorithms.
The goal is for a effective pluggable architecture to be implemented, such that anyone can plug in a new algorithm.
